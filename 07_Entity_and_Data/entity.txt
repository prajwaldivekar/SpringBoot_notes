In Spring Boot , the @Entity annotation is used to mark a class as a JPA entity. 
A JPA entity represents a table in a relational database, and each instance of the class corresponds to a row in that table.

**Code**
import jakarta.persistence.Entity;

@Entity
public class Product {
    private int id;
    private String name;
    private int price;
}


**What does @Entity do?
When you annotate a class with @Entity, Spring and JPA:

1. Treat the class as a table in the database.
2. Each field becomes a column (unless marked otherwise).
3. You can use @Id to mark the primary key.
4. Spring Boot will automatically map the class to a table with the same name (or you can customize it).

You're playing with toys, and each toy is special â€” like a car, a doll, or a robot.
Now, imagine you're making a toy list in your notebook. You draw a car, give it a name, color, and how much it costs.

You're telling Spring Boot:
"Hey! This Toy is real and I want to save it in my database notebook."

So, what is @Entity?
 It means: "This is a real thing that I want to store in the database."
Just like you write your toy's name and color in your notebook,
Spring Boot writes this class data in the database.
