What is @Data in Spring Boot? (Detailed Explanation)
@Data is a special annotation from Lombok, a Java library.

When you put @Data on a class, Lombok automatically creates all the common code for you â€” like:

- getters (getName())
- setters (setName())
- toString() method
- equals() and hashCode() methods
- A constructor for all fields



You must have Lombok installed in your project for @Data to work!
