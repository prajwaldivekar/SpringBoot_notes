What is @Data in Spring Boot? (Detailed Explanation)
@Data is a special annotation from Lombok, a Java library.

When you put @Data on a class, Lombok automatically creates all the common code for you — like:

- getters (getName())
- setters (setName())
- toString() method
- equals() and hashCode() methods
- A constructor for all fields

You must have Lombok installed in your project for @Data to work!

What is @Data? (Like a 5-Year-Old)
Imagine you have a toy that can talk, show its name, change its color, and tell if it’s same as another toy.
But you don’t want to build all that stuff every time.
So, you put a magic sticker on it — ✨ @Data
That sticker says:

"Hey! Make this toy smart — let it speak, change itself, and compare with other toys!"

Now your toy can:
-Tell you its name (getter)
-Let you change its name (setter)
-Talk about itself (toString)
-Check if it’s the same as another (equals)
-And more — without extra work!
