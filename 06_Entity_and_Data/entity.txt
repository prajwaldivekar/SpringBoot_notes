In Spring Boot , the @Entity annotation is used to mark a class as a JPA entity. 
A JPA entity represents a table in a relational database, and each instance of the class corresponds to a row in that table.

**Code**
import jakarta.persistence.Entity;

@Entity
public class Product {
    private int id;
    private String name;
    private int price;
}


**What does @Entity do?
When you annotate a class with @Entity, Spring and JPA:

Treat the class as a table in the database.

Each field becomes a column (unless marked otherwise).

You can use @Id to mark the primary key.

Spring Boot will automatically map the class to a table with the same name (or you can customize it).

You're playing with toys, and each toy is special â€” like a car, a doll, or a robot.

Now, imagine you're making a toy list in your notebook. You draw a car, give it a name, color, and how much it costs.
