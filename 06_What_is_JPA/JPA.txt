**What is JPA? (Detailed Explanation)
* JPA = Java Persistence API
JPA is a specification (a set of rules and guidelines) in Java to help developers store, update, delete, and read data from databases using Java objects.

**What is JPA? (Like a 5-year-old)
JPA is like a helper who saves your toys in a toy box (database).

**Let’s say:
-You have toys (like a car, doll, ball).
-You want to save them in a big toy box.
-But you don’t know how to open the toy box or organize toys.

** JPA is your magic helper who:
-Puts your toy in the box 🧸 ➡️ 📦
-Finds your toy when you ask 🧸 ⬅️ 📦
-Removes your toy when you don’t want it anymore ❌🧸

You just say:

“Hey JPA, here’s my toy, save it!”
or
“Hey JPA, I want my red car!”
and it does it all for you — no need to worry about how the box works inside!





**Why Use JPA?
Without JPA, working with databases means writing lots of SQL code (like SELECT * FROM product, INSERT INTO, etc.).
 JPA lets you focus on Java objects, and it handles the SQL in the background.

 ** How JPA Helps You
JPA allows you to:

1. Create a class like Product.java
2. Annotate it with @Entity
3. Automatically map it to a table in the database (like product_table)
4. Use methods like save(), findById(), delete() — without writing SQL
